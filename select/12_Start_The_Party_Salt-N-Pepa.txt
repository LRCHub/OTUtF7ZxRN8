I'm gettin' dressed for the jam about to jump in my mercedes
Slippin' on my dancin' shoes cuz i'm a lady of the eighties
It's friday night i just got paid my house is pumpin'
Or listenin' to my hammer tape while my sound system is dumpin'
Picked up my girl salty she was waitin' on the porch
I shared my fly fly mercedes yo lit the highway like a torch
On the way to pick up spindy we raced with a 1 9 d
He was a sucker duck if he thought he could buck with us in e
The party started

Let's get this party started
Let's get this party started right

Rolled up at the party, saw a fella black and fine
Bow-legged, high-top fade, then i said, "yo, that one's mine"
Stepped out of the ride, told the bouncer, "hold my benzy"
Heard the bass, it was the place so i slipped my man a penny
When we walked in the jam fans met us at the door
They yelled, "we love you salt and pepa!" "yes, we love y'all even more!"
Some foul, wack, nappy bitty tried to step to spinderella
I was cool, i made my move, then i droppped her like a fella
Start the party, boy

Now this is what you call a hip-hop beat from s and p
So get out on the dancefloor, and don't even rough with me
I ain't goin' for it, i ain't buyin' it so don't even try me
Dance sucker, mother tucker can, that old lady gets busy
Yeah, i don't give a damn, salty is who i am
And man, i'm gonna slam this jam, you understand?
Yes, we will stay the queens no matter what the means
The party started, let's get retarded, now work them bluejeans
Rock the party, y'all

Yes, i told the people move, he made a move
To the stage and grabbed the mic
From these stank, sorry, frauds - run d.m.c. look-alikes
Spinderella took the set, made her fingers nice and wet
And you bet she made that dj sweat, and he won't soon forget
Pepa took on the speaker, bust an oh, so funky rhyme
I did a step right on time and made the crowd lose their minds
The whole place was on the floor, we was rockin' hardcore-core
We left them wantin' more, and we headed out the door
We rocked the party
